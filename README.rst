``hgl-rs``, short for "gl helpers for Rust", provides some boilerplate for
working with OpenGL. I wrote it as part of my `graphics
course`_ at Clarkson_.

.. note::
    ``hgl-rs`` exposes a safe interface, but it is still trivial to create
    invalid state that would cause GL to be memory unsafe. ``hgl-rs`` does not
    attempt to provide an actual safe wrapper for GL, but rather a convenient
    Rusty wrapper around the concepts GL exposes.
